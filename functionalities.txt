In the first Experiment, the functionalities which need to be put are as follows:

1. A dropdown with English, Hindi and Select Language as the options.
2. Clickable buttons pertaining to each word of a sentence which has been been jumbled and need to be put in for the sentence to be syntactically and semantically correct.
3. After clicking on any button, the corresponding word should display in a line and a Reform the Sentence button should be seen so as to reset the whole thing.
4. Only when all the buttons are clicked, a button named Check the correctness of the sentence is to be displayed.
5. For wrong answers, the right answers should be displayed after a button Click for Solution is pressed. Nothing is to be done for a correct answer.
6. Everytime the page is loaded, the order of the buttons containing the words is to be jumbled.


For adding buttons, we will store the sentences in JSON format and the using spli, sort, random and join functions, we will get different words of the sentence.
Then we will put those words inside button tags and display it in the DOM.

In the HTML file, we will create a select tag and have three options as Select language, english and hindi which when selected will display a sentence saying â€œForm a sentence (Declarative or Interrogative or any other type) from the given words(select the buttons in proper order)".
